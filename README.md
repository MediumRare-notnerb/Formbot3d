## This resource was created to help make the build proccess from a formbot kit much easier, but you will also want to check out the voron docs [here.](https://docs.vorondesign.com/)


## Getting Started
Start by getting yourself familiarized with the build. You can do this a number of ways. I reccomend to watch build streams and hang around the the voron and formbot discord servers to get a idea of how the machine works. Once you recieve the kit, you should get a head-start by familiarizing yourself with the parts and tools you have and organize them all. 



#### That begs the question, "what do I need to build a printer from one of these kits?"

Well lucky for you, I made a list!


**The Main Tools:**
* Soldering iron
* Isopropyl alcohol
* Paper towels
* Crimping tools
* Grease for the linear rails - Mobilux ep2 is best for our average use case
* Threadlocker (blue/medium strength)
* Some metric allen keys
* PH screwdriver
* Machinests square
* Flat surface for assembling frame
* Flat-head screwdriver

**Very Nice Things To Have:**
* Digital multimeter
* Spare wire
* Exacto knife
* Gloves for handling grease and ISO
* Tweezers
* Flush cutters
* Spare hardware, wire, and crimps
* Digital calipers 


## Printing

Head over to the `2.4 STLs` and download all of the files there if you are printing parts for a 2.4 "pro" kit. The `Custom STLs` folder are files from outside of the voron github repository and should have everything you need for the 2.4 "pro".

The `250`, `300`, `350`  folders contain the parts needed for each build volume. **So make sure to print the relevant ones!**


If you run into problems with your build or have quesitons reach out to formbot directly or ask on their discord server [here.](https://discord.gg/) 

For a amazing guide on configuring CAN for the "pro" kits check out [this](https://github.com/Esoterical/voron_canbus) great guide by esoterical.

You can tag me on discord (notnerb.) for general questions in the public channels of their server, but I want to stress the fact that I am in no way getting paid by formbot to compile this resource nor am I the person to ask when it comes to any detail related to your order. 

You can reach out to thier support for those questions:
