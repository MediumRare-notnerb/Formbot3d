# Formbot3d

### This resource was created to help make the build proccess from a formbot kit much easier, but you will also want to check out the voron docs [here.](https://docs.vorondesign.com/) 


If you run into problems with your build or have quesitons reach out to formbot directly or ask on their discord server [here.](https://discord.gg/) 

For a amazing guide on configuring CAN for the "pro" kits check out [this](https://github.com/Esoterical/voron_canbus) great guide by esoterical.

You can tag me (notnerb.) for general questions in the public channels of their server, but I want to stress the fact that I am in no way getting paid by formbot to compile this resource nor am I the person to ask when it comes to any detail related to your order. 

You can reach out to thier support for those questions:
